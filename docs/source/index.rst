meow-tea-taro documentation
===========================

**Meow Tea Taro** is a Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning Framework for training agents in interactive environments like TextWorld and ALFWorld.

.. note::
   This project is under active development. APIs may change between versions.

We use verl (add url: https://github.com/volcengine/verl) as the backbone architecture. 
We make minimum modifications to **verl** and provide a **ready-to-use** and **customizable** framework for training multi-turn agentic RL.
The learning curve for **meow-tea-taro** would be very low if you are already familiar with **verl**.
